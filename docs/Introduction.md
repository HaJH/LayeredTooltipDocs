> This plugin enables you to **link additional tooltips to text within tooltip content**.  
> Deliver complex game information progressively, allowing players to explore information at their desired depth through an extensible system that works across all UI elements.

#### **Key Features**

- **Rich Text-Based Tooltip Linking**

> Automatically display tooltips over tagged words using Rich Text decorator functionality. Simply add tags to create interactive, explorable content.

- **Automatic Mouse-Over Tooltips**

> Slate widget mouse events are automatically detected - widgets registered with the tooltip system display tooltips and manage their lifecycle without additional logic.

- **UObject-Level Extensibility**

> Beyond Rich Text and widgets, manually register any UObject to control tooltip behavior. Trigger timing requires manual setup, with a convenient mouse-over component provided for Actors.

#### **Playable Demo:** [Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1whF9vxrPeLvyydAoU8f4zokTZSpMLy3n/view?usp=sharing)
